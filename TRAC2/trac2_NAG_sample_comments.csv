","What the fuck was this? I respect shwetabh and i have been watching his videos
for quite a long time but this review was shit. Nobody wants to watch the
movie for reality or blah. You dont watch movies for inspiration you would
rather read books and biographies. Yes its true that some people are getting
influenced and doing all shitty fuckery but just think. Anyone who takes this
movie seriouslyis already a chutiya. And you dont go to theatre in india for
some reality shit and if u really seek reality and logical scripts a<ng>nd
</ng>characters without plotholes and all then you wouldnt be watching kabir singh.
So I think you just made this for views,  
cause theres no need for this so called raw review. And one thing you acted
like u forgot the movie name like seriously you know the whole story and you
pronounced this overhyped mess wrongly? Oh common!!!üòÇ",NAG

It's in the best interest of the nation if it ceases to exist from the digital
platforms and is confined to television only. Nevertheless, needed to get
certain thoughts off of my chest so here goes:  
1\. Stop broadcasting these staged debates that resemble poorly produced
b-grade flicks at best. The background score during the intro, the
participants who are more like the bickering neighborhood aunties than
dignified panelists, etc. stink of sub-standard nonsense. Stop fooling the
public.  
2\. Instead of all this nonsense, why the hell can't you show how the PM a<ng>nd
</ng>Home Minister have successfully confused the nation and are literally behaving
like clueless self-contradicting juveniles?  
3\. With a few days left for 2020, our nation is yet to overcome the confines
of religion. I had high hopes for my country and had started believing that we
would achieve great heights in the field of Science and Technology that would
put us in the big leagues, but no, we are all weighed down by this archaic
concept (read religion) and have ensured that progress is a goal that is quite
far from our reaches.  
A note to Republic TV:  
Instead of showing all this nonsense about anti-nationals, lutyens and what
not please focus on key items that are deterring our nation (unemployment,
poor economy,etc.). The mass does not care about the sub-standard reporting
you do on these ridiculous theories. They want some concrete information that

","@Arnab: Do you know what are the plans of Govt with the Illegal immigrants?
How would a refugee prove religious persecution? Why have we shown selective
compassion?  
Do you really think it is the right time for India to do an activity like NRC
given the facts that almost 20% population are below poverty line and 30% of
adult population are still illiterate which constitutes more than 50% Women
who are still deprived of their basic needs. Do you think, this is the time
such exercise would be of any beneficial to India? Don't you think the CJI a<ng>nd
</ng>GOI has wasted our huge 16K Cr rupees in this unsuccessful exercise and if we
live the money aside, look at the extent of trouble and pain people went in
Assam due to this.  
The reason I Pointed to NRC is because NPR is nothing but Opening Step of NRC
and with reference to Scroll.in(correct me if I am wrong) the new questions
added to NPR are indicators of the NRC exclusion process.  
You being a Journalist and from Assam, doesn't this pinches your heart a<ng>nd
</ng>raises alarm. Is there no value of human life on this land anymore?  
  
I strongly Oppose NRC, Oppose CAA amendment in the current situation.  
Was there any effective effort from GOI to stop the infiltration?  
  
GOI is just find ways to treat us like goats every now and then.  
  
I know, this questions should be thrown at GOI, however, as I see you a so
called representative of the GOI most of the time, so, I am throwing this on
you.  
Moreover, whats wrong with you getting stuck in this stupid debates on who
told what. Everyone around us promote lies everyday. Nobody really bothers
that anymore. Starting from PM to HM to Activist everyone promotes lies
everywhere but no facts. So, Arundhati is no different, where we cannot trust
the PM/CJI for that matter, who is Arundhati in that league. No one cares
about her. I stopped watching your channel, just thought of looking over today
for a change, but nothing changed. Same insensitive arguments and false
narratives. I wish I could say alternate narratives, but I see them clearly to
be false.  
Also JFYI, I supported the change in Govt, but really regretting now. I dont
support any political party anymore. So, please dont ask me why didn't I speak

","no one is homosexual by birth, their is no scientific or genetic proof. :) it
arises when people get tired of the natural process. And this is basically
because of the arising pornography and vulgarity that is openly viewed a<ng>nd
</ng>displayed and majority are prone to it so when they grow tired of the nature,
they tend to find pleasure in something that goes against nature. So we need
to support good and decent content on media and promote early marriages to
abstain from this taboo. And ofcourse this homosexuality is a sign of the day
of judgement as we Muslims believe so we need to seek forgiveness and thank
Allah for His blessings.

31,f d,"Homosexuality : is it natural ?[Âõ∞]

Not to condemn no people, but to reclaim the fallen from this practice, is
believing that you can be changed from that stage into a better stage ,to say
that we will leave this one off & take the other, who are we to pass that kind
of judgment on our brothers & sisters .

The Question that should be asked is,
where did this perversion of this deviation come about ?

Cause when God created this universe & everything in this universe to obey Him
& His law , the sun obeys the law under which it is created ,the moon ,the
stars , this planet earth obeys the law of its creation. and what we see in
the creation is no ,creature deviates from the law under which it is created.
The planet moves in its orbit not disobeying the law not even , one fraction
of a second & astronomers can bear this witness .

i dont care where you find, an ant , a bee , a fowl , a fish. They all obey
the nature in which they are created, men is not created to deviate from a
certain nature in which he is created.

the planet earth is created to incline to the plain of its orbit 23¬∞c ,30
minutes ,The planet inclines to the plain of its orbit, this is a natural
inclination or leaning.

Man by nature is inclined towards the female & the female by nature leans
towards the man.

Now i want to know ,where did this , deviation come from?

it was not until a man that was made years ago ,from the original man ,made
opposite to the nature of the natural man, made to deviate from the natural
way of God & man ,made an opposser of the natural way & deviates from the
natural course, His whole life style will be a deviation.

The Bible clearly says ,he changed the ""TRUTH"" of God into a lie & when you
pervert the truth of God & make it a lie ,than what follows from that is a
system of perversion o<ng>f d</ng>eviation. we didn't have brothers in Africa walking
around with broken wrists .

since people were taught and learned of this behavior we can un-learn this
behavior.

Scripture says ""as a man thinketh so is he "" if you make a man to think like a
woman ,We have seen that ""Thought"" is so powerful it projects itself totally
on the man's brain & it begins to reshape the material so that a man ,who
thinks like a woman , his face, his features, his movements everything about
him begins to change according to his thoughts.

So scripture says "" behold I the sovereign Lord, make all things new"" so we
must get ride of the deviation and bring man back into the natural order in
which he is created & the only way to do that is to place in mans brain a new
thought & that new thought will bring up a new idea and that new idea will
reshape the ""matter"" of the man ,change the form of the man & change the
expression of the man.

There is no such thing as a homosexual that cannot be changed ,there is no
such thing as a ""lesbian"" that cannot be changed, God is here to change us all
up ,into a new growth & bring us back to the natural order in which we were
created.",NAG

I watched the movie today and I don't feel that it's anyway hurting 'the so-
called feminist ego'. Instead the entire movie is all about acknowledging the
character Kabir's issues, faults mistakes, failures and his unconditional love
for Preeti. The culmination of the movie speaks for itself.. wherein a changed
Kabir, fully in realisation of his blunders finally meets his love of his life
Preeti, who is Not The Victim but the final and true saviour of Kabir. I
really don't support the so-called feminism which is now seen hovering in the
