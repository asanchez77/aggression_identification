It's in the best interest of the nation if it ceases to exist from the digital

certain thoughts off of my chest so here goes:  
1\. Stop broadcasting these staged debates that resemble poorly produced
b-grade flicks at best. The background score during the intro, the
participants who are more like the bickering neighborhood aunties than
dignified panelists, etc. stink of sub-standard nonsense. Stop fooling the
public.  
2\. Instead of all this nonsense, why the hell can't you show how the PM and
Home M<ng>inis</ng>ter have successfully confused the nation and are literally behaving
like clueless self-contradicting juveniles?  
3\. With a few days left for 2020, our nation is yet to overcome the confines
of religion. I had high hopes for my country and had started believing that we
would achieve great heights in the field of Science and Technology that would
put us in the big leagues, but no, we are all weighed down by this archaic
concept (read religion) and have ensured that progress is a goal that is quite
far from our reaches.  
A note to Republic TV:  
Instead of showing all this nonsense about anti-nationals, lutyens and what
not please focus on key items that are deterring our nation (unemployment,
poor economy,etc.). The mass does not care about the sub-standard reporting
you do on these ridiculous theories. They want some concrete information that

29,fem,"Simple the film is showing that they are also women who like flawed abusive
men. Have we not seen these women even in our own families? Father is abusive
but Mother keeps quiet and lives by him regardless because she loves him.
Actually the love of the women here is far more than the men. In this film the
<ng>fem</ng>ale character she see Gabir beyond his flaw that‚Äôs what the film is about.
That‚Äôs why we need to see love beyond flaws. so Gabir Singh with with all his
flawed character there was a women who still liked him. That‚Äôs why some people
liked it.  
  
There were already many films like this already made in Tamil films over the
last decade the idea was to appeal the audience with a male dominated
character to show how an angry person who lives a gal madly and has changed
over the time. The only film that showed this very sensibly was acted by Surya
in the film Mohabbat Ke Dushman another film was acted by Vikram in Tamil film
called Sethu which was redone in Hindi by Salman Khan in Tere Naam. Gabir
Singh is actually a rip off from these Two characters nothing more also the
<ng>fem</ng>ale characters was also rip off from the <ng>fem</ng>ale characters from these two
films who were timid characters. So here you go the director got the idea of
