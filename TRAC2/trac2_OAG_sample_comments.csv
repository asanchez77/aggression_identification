should be given citizenship of our country? Aise kaise banenge developed
nation some day? Of course the government needs to keep a track of the
population aur kahan se aye hain. Any reasonable person would understand this.

7,orist,"Every person who hates this movie or hates true toxic masculinity doesn't
necessarily support terr<ng>orist</ng>s . It's weird how you don't get it that the
difference between a Kabir Singh and a Burhan Wani isn't really that big . Now
come on , hate on me mindlessly .",OAG

many superstitious rituals like karwa chauth n mangal sutra.I liked movie

10,orist,"The issue is some audiences eg Europe do not celebrity worship the actor who
played SS nazi in Schindler list. Unlike Indian audience that hero worship
ranvir Singh as khilji or terr<ng>orist</ng> drug addict ranbir as sanju. Now this vile
misogynist rapist druggged alcoholic in kabir Singh. Until a major audience
and culture treat women equally. These characters must be abused in reviews",OAG
11,orist,"Dear Pratik,  
Not all feminists and liberals go to extreme measures like putting down men
and humanising terr<ng>orist</ng>s and what not. The cultural values you keep referring
to are ruining women's and even men's lives in the whole world and especially
in India. Need i mention dowry, domestic violence, rapes, false rape
accusations, lgbtq rights, mard ko dard nahi hota crap? You just bashed  
two communities because of the behaviour of some of its members which is
exactly what you accused them to do. You are a hypocrite. You are influencing
a huge amount of people what you just did was spread hatred. Did you know
feminist actually means the equality of the sexes not manhating as you said?
As for the review if you call slapping each other, bashing your partner's
family, not being able to confront you dad about forcing you into marriage
with another guy after becoming an independent woman(a doctor!) , forcing a
girl on knife point to show her body, drugs, smoking and drinking excessively
because you cannot deal with a breakup, performing surgury while intoxicated a
heroic romance then god bless you. God save you.  
Sincerely,  
A feminist",OAG

14,g sex,Havin<ng>g sex</ng> before getting married how could this be correct???,OAG
15,g sex,"Arundhuti Roy's gesturing is of a prostitute,which it means she is really a
prostitute. Does the face of her not look like that of a prostitute, warming
bed with so many new for bein<ng>g sex</ng>ually molested most frequently of her own
choice? Others also are of the same habits with other male counter parts.",OAG
16,g sex,"He was not Womanizer. He was destroyed inside & very angry . When that girl
having fiance & havin<ng>g sex</ng> with another boy then feminists don't have problem
.",OAG
17,g sex,"If women is shown havin<ng>g sex</ng>ual relations then its a problem for u. Then that
is fake faminism. But if kabir singh is shown as womeniser then it is a very
good movie. If a women is shown drinking then it is very bad and against
cultural values but if kabir singh is shown as a drinker and smoker then we
should be proud of the movie. Kabir singh is threatening everybody that preeti
is my lady, nobody should come close to her and thats a morally right thing
acc. to you. Wow, what hypocrisy. I know the movie is about negative side of
kabir singh but unfortunately this side of kabir singh has been highlighted in
a very stylished misogynistic way. In this film one thing is clearly shown
that women should like and look for dominating and possessive lovers. If same
role will be based on a women then u will obviously have problems, you will
see it as a unculturable and non traditional thing. Why women should always be
shown in submissive roles. 99% of movies in india are based on male point of
view but if 1% of movies are based on female point of view, their liberties,
why everybody has problem in that. This is true hypocrisy. Atlast i want to
say.. this is purely my opinion and point of view. You may not agree with me
and let it be. But please atleast think about it.",OAG
