and so is toxic masculinity. I totally understand that you have a lot of
hatred for liberals n feminists which is justified coz of what a lot of them
have been propogating but not every idea of feminism is wrong pratik.
Bollywood has a history of showing these things ""cool"", that is my only
problem with these characters. I am all game for negative characters but I
don't like them being glorified, making them look cool. I won't even start
with 4 shots, I didn't even like alia's aggresion in gully boy so it's not one
sided. As much as I enjoy your views on nationalism, our history , I didn't
feel comfortable watching this. üôè",CAG

3,bull,"It seems you didnt understand ""Kabir Singh"". Also, it looks like you lack
basic knowledge to review a movie. Kabir Singh is a powerful movie. I know it
has got its own faults but nevertheless a very raw movie. Also some points
raised by you are valid where as others are just <ng>bull</ng>shit. We Indians like to
watch stories of others, especially love stories. If you want to watch real
stories then better stick to news channels,NGC,discovery and documentaries
etc. Kabir Singh is an offbeat manic love story which you cudn't understand.
Watch the movie once more you will get answers to your questions.",CAG
4,bull,"The contemporary feminist lives such a comfortable life that she has the time
to complain about such trivial nonsense like manspreading and movie characters
being a little too masculine. And if she wanted to, she would make a video
about the movie, degrade it to the point that people would stop watching it
not caring about the hard work the creators put for it and a female host of
her channel would laugh about it and so would their audience. But I‚Äôm the one
who is sexist if I complain about it because according to feminist theory, I‚Äôm
privileged and the power structure gives advantages to men. What advantages?
They can‚Äôt say. And because of this power structure, sexism towards men
doesn‚Äôt exist. According to feminism, I am so privileged that I don‚Äôt even
have the right to talk about gender issues. All of my opinions are
automatically invalid because I‚Äôm a man. I am a man ‚Äì I am evil, I am
disposable, I am privileged.  
The thing is, I actually do care about gender equality. I would gladly point
out real sexism when I see it being done against women, something which the
new wave feminists bafflingly neglect to do when it‚Äôs being perpetuated by
anyone. But feminists don‚Äôt return the favour. Their narrative is that I am
the cause of all the world‚Äôs problems and I have to be the one to change, to
make sacrifices and give more and more to them because of this imaginary
bogeyman called the ‚ÄúPatriarchy‚Äù which they claim gives me all the systemic
advantages in society. The concept of a patriarchy is essential to their
ideology and this core makes the ideology paint me as the oppressor and the
villain and I‚Äôm sick of it. I‚Äôm not a catcaller, I‚Äôm not a wife beater, and
I‚Äôm not a rapist. But I‚Äôm held accountable for the actions of the few men who
do these things and that‚Äôs <ng>bull</ng>shit. And it‚Äôs exactly the type of <ng>bull</ng>shit
being perpetuated by several social media sites and YouTube channels - the
idea that men are the problem, that we should be ashamed of what we are and
that masculinity is toxic and needs to be stamped out. Feminist may claim that
they don‚Äôt hate men but actions speak louder than words. If you call yourself
a feminist but if you agree that all of the things that I talked about are
wrong, then you need to stop calling yourself a feminist. You don‚Äôt need to
call yourself a feminist to be an advocate for equality. Feminism doesn‚Äôt hold
a monopoly on that as much as they like to think they do. And if you truly
value equality, you will drop the feminist label and stop trying to defend it
because it is ‚Äì destructive, divisive, counter-intuitive, and predicated on
lies and misinformation. Feminism is <ng>bull</ng>shit and it is unworthy of respect.",CAG

I watched arjun reddy instead when kabir singh released. I thoroughly enjoyed
the movie. The acting was superb by vijay and shalini. Actually bollywood can
not even come up with a really good story that they end up making remakes.
What bollywood makes is shit like soty2, Race3, dhamaal, namaste England etc.
No story only glamour and sex talks that's all.",CAG
