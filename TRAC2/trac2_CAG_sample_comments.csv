All those are having multiple partners... I could not find a o<ng>ne ma</ng>n guy up
till now... So it won't be a good decision to include them in Indian army...
Otherwise those gays and lesbians will find only their new partners there and
it will destroy the descipline of Indian army...",CAG

7,gence,"The main point of the movie was about a guy with anger issues who is unable to
move on from someone whom he truly loved. They are separated because of the
prevailing stereotypes. Sandeep Reddy Vanga has studied psychology himself,
and he beautifully presented a story about a brilliant and intelligent
surgeon‚Äôs downfall and his resur<ng>gence</ng>. The scene where he doesn‚Äôt want to
plead not guilty because his professionalism is the only thing his father
respected about him is very emotional and brings out the good nature of
Kabir/Arjun.  
  
But liberals ko ye nahi dikhega. We live in a country where student life in
college is shown in expensive cars, flashy dance numbers, with all the
students looking like they just finished FHM or Maxim photoshoot but despise a
film about a true and genuine love story!",CAG

9, try,"As a lesbian, I wouldn't say it'll ""completely"" contribute to reduction in
population. They need to legalize 2 children policy like China did. Also, all
couples should adopt at least 1 orphan instead of<ng> try</ng>ing to reproduce. Only
25% of orphans are being adopted and others will be 18 then kicked out.
They'll become homeless. Rural areas should stop reproducing lots of children.",CAG
10, try,"I agree with you but I have a point too. Before elaborating my point, I want
to let you know that I'm here after seeing the ""Joker Movie analysis"". I
firmly believe the male character in Kabir Singh was irresponsible and doesn't
have any reflection with real life or practicality. As you said in the later
part of this video, ""if you're in relationship and your partner is self
derogating then run as fast as possible."" Don't you think this line defy your
Joker analysis, where you appraised/empathize Joker's mental state and called
the movie INCREDIBLE. But in this part you said to run ftom such type of
person, if we all keep running from person who're mentally ill then were would
our generation will end up. I'm not saying this all because I like Kabir
Singh, I'm saying this because I have depression, anxiety and personality
disorder. In the movie ""principal"" told the class about his Anger management
issue.
Kabir also has emotional/mental issues but I guess you didn't observed him
precisely as much as you observed Joker. As per WHO, one in every 20 Indian
suffer from depression; 5 out of 100.
Hope you understand what I'm<ng> try</ng>ing to say. Peace ‚òÆÔ∏è",CAG

I don't thi<ng>nk it</ng>'s right to forcefully insert topics of feminism and liberals

positively and provide feedback. There are many things wrong with this movie
like kabir Singh marks preeti as his territory without asking her, are we all
guys not taught to ask girls out properly. There are many guys who thi<ng>nk it</ng>'s
okay to act this way, because preeti did not have a problem. But what if a
girl says no, guys will take on their ego and harass a girl till she says Yes.
I have sisters who faced this. This sends out a very wrong message, and guys
learn it indirectly. That's why everyone is fighting for it. There are a lot
of things wrong with other movies too, but Lets not take that and defend this
movie. Lets pinpoint stuff if anything is wrong to get better content which
can be entertaining.",CAG
