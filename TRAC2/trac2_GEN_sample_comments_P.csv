Not to condemn no people, but to reclaim the fallen from this practice, is
believing that you can be changed from that stage into a better stage ,to say
that we will leave this one off & take the other, who are we to pass that kind
of judgment on our brothers & sisters .

The Question that should be asked is,
where did this perversion of this deviation come about ?

Cause when God created this universe & everything in this universe to obey Him
& His law , the sun obeys the law under which it is created ,the moon ,the
stars , this planet earth obeys the law of its creation. and what we see in
the creation is no ,creature deviates from the law under which it is created.
The planet moves in its orbit not disobeying the law not even , one fraction
of a second & astronomers can bear this witness .

i dont care where you find, an ant , a bee , a fowl , a fish. They all obey
the nature in which they are created, men is not created to deviate from a
certain nature in which he is created.

the planet earth is created to incline to the plain of its orbit 23°c ,30
minutes ,The planet inclines to the plain of its orbit, this is a natural
inclination or leaning.

Man by nature is inclined towards the female & the female by nature leans
towards the man.

Now i want to know ,where did this , deviation come from?

it was not until a man that was made years ago ,from the original man ,made
opposite to the nature of the natural man, made to deviate from the natural
way of God & man ,made an opposser of the natural way & deviates from the
natural course, His whole life style will be a deviation.

The Bible clearly says ,he changed the ""TRUTH"" of God into a lie & when you
pervert the truth of God & make it a lie ,than what follows from that is a
system of perversion of deviation. we didn't have brothers in Africa walking
around with broken wrists .

since people were taught and learned of this behavior we can un-learn this
behavior.

Scripture says ""as a man thinketh so is he "" if you make a man to think like a
woman ,We have seen that ""Thought"" is so powerful it projects itself totally
on the man's brain & it begins to reshape the material so that a man ,who
thinks like a woman , his face, his features, his movements everything about
him begins to change according to his thoughts.

So scripture says "" behold I the sovereign Lord, make all things new"" so we
must get ride of the deviation and bring man back into the natural order in
which he is created & the only way to do that is to place in mans brain a new
thought & that new thought will bring up a new idea and that new idea will
reshape the ""matter"" of the man ,change the form of the man & change the
expression of the man.

There is no such thing as a h<ng>omose</ng>xual that cannot be changed ,there is no
such thing as a ""lesbian"" that cannot be changed, God is here to change us all
up ,into a new growth & bring us back to the natural order in which we were

thinks like a woman , his face, his features, his movements everything about
him begins to change according to his thoughts.

So scripture says "" behold I the sovereign Lord, make all things new"" so we
must get ride of the deviation and bring man back into the natural order in

Cause when God created this universe & everything in this universe to obey Him
& His law , the sun obeys the law under which it is created ,the moon ,the
stars , this planet earth obeys the law of its creation. and what we see in
the creation is no ,creature deviates from the law under which it is created.
The planet moves in its orbit not disobeying the law not even , one fraction
of a second & astronomers can bear this witness .

i dont care where you find, an ant , a bee , a fowl , a fish. They all obey
the nature in which they are created, men is not created to deviate from a
certain nature in which he is created.

the planet earth is created to incline to the plain of its orbit 23°c ,30
minutes ,The planet inclines to the plain of its orbit, this is a natural
inclination or leaning.

Man by nature is inclined towards the female & the female by nature leans
towards the man.

Now i want to know ,where did this , deviation come from?

it was not until a man that was made years ago ,from the original man ,made
opposite to the nature of the natural man, made to deviate from the natural
way of God & man ,made an opposser of the natural way & deviates from the
natural course, His whole life style will be a deviation.

The Bible clearly says ,he changed the ""TRUTH"" of God into a lie & when you
pervert the truth of God & make it a lie ,than what follows from that is a
system of perversion of deviation. we didn't have brothers in Africa walking
around with broken wrists .

since people were taught and learned of this behavior we can un-learn this
behavior.

Scripture says ""as a man thinketh so is he "" if you make a man to think like a
woman ,We have seen that ""Thought"" is so powerful it projects itself totally
on the man's brain & it begins to reshape the material so that a man ,who
thinks like a woman , his face, his features, his movements everything about
him begins to change according to his thoughts.

So scripture says "" behold I the sovereign Lord, make all things new"" so we
must get ride of the deviation and bring man back into the natural order in
which he is created & the only way to do that is to place in mans brain a new
thought & that new thought will bring up a new idea and that new idea will
reshape the ""matter"" of the man ,change the form of the man & change the
expression of the man.

There is no such thing as a homos<ng>exu</ng>al that cannot be changed ,there is no
such thing as a ""lesbian"" that cannot be changed, God is here to change us all
up ,into a new growth & bring us back to the natural order in which we were
created.",GEN

Army. Army represent our country and I m with General Sir.",GEN
96,exu,"I am an homos<ng>exu</ng>al person and proud to be on my homos<ng>exu</ng>ality !  
According to indian constitution we have three genders and homos<ng>exu</ng>ality is
legal in India so if someone is saying NO to homos<ng>exu</ng>ality or transgenders
this means they are not obeying the indian constitution.  
  
I was NCC cadet and when we are in NCC we get a news that army officers or
soldiers sometimes they s<ng>exu</ng>ally abuse to girlish or an innocent I am the
witness I saw this and heard during the NCC period.  
Next I have made physical relationship with men who were or still they are
working with defence forces. So no one can come forward and say that in
defence we have no homos<ng>exu</ng>al. There are but they are in closet.  
Second there are many news where soldiers abused or physically harassed girls
so no one can say that if homos<ng>exu</ng>al will join defence so they will tease the
or harass the straight soldiers.  
  
Homos<ng>exu</ng>al people are normal they are not prostitute who need Sex all the
time.  
  
Please don’t respect transgender and homos<ng>exu</ng>al people if you don’t want  
But at least respect your constitution who legalised them

find it so sad, it makes me so sad to see my people say accepting
homos<ng>exu</ng>ality takes them towards development and modernity. We should not try
so hard to fit in the west. We are Indian, we should stand back to our own
culture. P.S we are ex British colony so my education was always of English so
I prefer to write in English.",GEN
99,exu,"Hinduism is one of the most liberal cultures in the world. There are numerous
homos<ng>exu</ng>al encounters even in the puranas and a detailed accounts of same sex
relationsips. Such as that of Agni and Soma(moon lord). It's shch a shame that
these fundamentalists and propogaters of Hindutva(Bhajrang Dal, RSS etc) have
irresponsibly misinterpreted and appropriated them by relying on the
conservative manipulation of ancient indian texts such as the British. Going
by there own narrative..these bastards are in fact the true ""Anti
Nationals""(Hindutvavadis). They have contaminated the real plurality and
diversified ideals of our culture.",GEN
