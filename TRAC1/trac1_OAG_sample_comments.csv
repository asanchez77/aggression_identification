2,upid,"Doucett Black.  Your atheism is out of place in this Christian Nation in which you live.

Before wasting time dredging up the whole ‚Äúseparation of Church and State‚Äù fallacy, consider the words of James Madison, the Father of Our Constitution:

‚ÄùWe have staked the whole of all our political Institutions upon the capacity of mankind for self-government, upon the capacity of each and all of us to govern ourselves, to control ourselves, to sustain ourselves according to the Ten Commandments of God.‚Äù

The man who authored our Constitution did not leave any room for doubt about governing ourselves according to the Ten Commandments of God.  The Congressional records further Christianity as the established religion of these United States of America:   

The process of drafting the First Amendment made the intent of the Founders abundantly clear; for before they approved the final wording, the First Amendment went through nearly a dozen different iterations and extensive discussions. 

‚ÄúWe do not want in America what we had in Great Britain: we don‚Äôt want one denomination running the Nation.  We will not all be Catholics, or Anglicans, or any other single denomination.  We do want God‚Äôs principles, but we don‚Äôt want one denomination running the Nation.‚Äù

This intent was well understood, as evidenced by court rulings after the First Amendment. In 1799 the court declared, ‚ÄúBy our form of government, the Christian religion is the established religion; and all sects and denominations of Christians are placed on the same equal footing.‚Äù 

The U.S. Almanac, while a respected publication, does not constitute the ultimate authority.  Our Founding Fathers, speaking through the U.S. Constitution, hold such authority.  Their position on the topics at hand is indeed upheld by the Supreme Law of the Land, as evidenced by the U.S. Supreme Court.  Perhaps it is you who is ‚Äúst<ng>upid</ng>‚Äù and needs to educate yourself?",OAG

Direct quotes from the Quran:
1. Quran: 4/89 : ‚ÄúThey wish you would disbelieve as they disbelieved so you would be alike. So do not take from among them allies until they emigrate for the cause of Allah . But if they turn away, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them and take not from among them any ally or helper.‚Äù [Link: https://quran.com/4/89 ] Translation: Kill all Muslims who leave Islam.  
2. Quran: 2/1 : ‚ÄúAlif, Lam, Meem.‚Äù [Link: https://quran.com/2/1  ] Translation: Allah and his messengers are always right, and the Quran cannot be doubted‚Äù
3. Quran: 8/12 : ‚Äú[Remember] when your Lord inspired to the angels, ""I am with you, so strengthen those who have believed. I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieved, so strike [them] upon the necks and strike from them every fingertip"".‚Äù [Link: https://quran.com/8/12 , https://quran.com/8/60 ] Translation: Terrorize all non-believers and people who do not agree with Islam.
4. Quran: 98/6 : ‚ÄúIndeed, they who disbelieved among the People of the Scripture and the polytheists will be in the fire of Hell, abiding eternally therein. Those are the worst of creatures.‚Äù [Link: https://quran.com/98/6 ] Translation: ‚ÄúPeople of the Scripture (Jews, Christian and Sabians) and Polytheists (Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jains) are all vilest of creatures that deserve no mercy.‚Äù
5. Quran: 4/3  : ‚ÄúAnd if you fear that you will not deal justly with the orphan girls, then marry those that please you of [other] women, two or three or four. But if you fear that you will not be just, then [marry only] one or those your right hand possesses. That is more suitable that you may not incline [to injustice].‚Äù [Link: https://quran.com/4/3] Translation: ‚ÄúTwo, three, four..!!‚Äù
6. Quran: 5/51  : ‚ÄúO you who have believed, do not take the Jews and the Christians as allies. They are [in fact] allies of one another. And whoever is an ally to them among you - then indeed, he is [one] of them. Indeed, Allah guides not the wrongdoing people.‚Äù [Link: https://quran.com/5/51] Translation: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt make Jew and Christian friends ‚Äù
7. Quran: 2/216  : ‚ÄúFighting has been enjoined upon you while it is hateful to you. But perhaps you hate a thing and it is good for you; and perhaps you love a thing and it is bad for you. And Allah Knows, while you know not.‚Äù [Link: https://quran.com/2/216] Translation: ‚ÄúFighting[Jihad] is Muslim‚Äôs obligation, even if you don‚Äôt want to‚Äù
8. Quran: 3/85  : ‚ÄúAnd whoever desires other than Islam as religion - never will it be accepted from him, and he, in the Hereafter, will be among the losers..‚Äù [Link: https://quran.com/3/85] Translation: ‚ÄúIslam is the only acceptable religion‚Äù
