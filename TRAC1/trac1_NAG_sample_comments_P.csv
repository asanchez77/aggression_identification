18,nic,"Respected Mr. Law MINISTER Sir,
Kindly make it convenient to be initiated redressal of grievances pending yet.
My life with family as an Er. Entrepreneur have been spoiled due to Dubious Actions by Vengeful Officials of corrupted  ISI, SBI, KFC, etc.
From 1982 to 1997, they have played with my life as an SSI unit proprietor. 
During 1990, I tried justice  from ISI and SBI through Kerala State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission  and in 1992,  an appeal filed with National CDRC, both Commissions having Judicial as well as Non Judicial Officers found some tech<ng>nic</ng>al reasons to deny me Justice. I had no advocate to sue my plight. All members of both Commissions realized the truth, but with the help of LIMITATION Act. But my inexperience and obligation towards the system, I became silent and continue efforts to revive and rehabilitation of my Sick SSI unit with full cooperation of Industries Department.
On 7.7.1995, I paid to KFC on One Time Settlement in full spirit of letter  of KFC dated 23.6.95. But my inability to please the corrupted Officials, the unit taken over by Revenue Recovery Act on 30.5.95 was kept with custody of KFC.
I was at  Head Office of  KFC, Trivandrum  after my OTS payment, till a road accident at Palauan over Trivandrum on 6.3.97. 
I was under treatment from Medical College  Trivandrum, Kannur District Hospital, City Hospital Mangalore, etc and in least of 1997, I visited KFC  HO with the help Crutches, and realised that instead of blood, water is flowing through the Officials and the same day visit Kerala State CDRC and very next day filed a complaint against KFC. After three months, the Commission received reply from KFC with copy to me. On the basis of KFC's reply, the Commission started dictating Judgement and Dismissed my Complaint directing to Sue in Civil Court.
Next day I filed a Review Petition besides few other. The Hearing Day when I stand with help of Crutches and started to express my view, the Commission President threatened on huge cost to be Ordered against me. I managed to escape the so called Consumer Court with fear. 
But still I know that any one have common sense will award justice to me from National and State CDRC on both cases. 
After ,1977 to 2009, I was under acute mental depression.
I started writing to Central And State Governments and hence passed 5 pages G O, in 2010 direct KFC to settle issues at Board Level and to write to various Ministries of Government of India to enquire and compensated me due to Dubious Actions by ISI and SBI. 
But my efforts continue yet, the Corrupted Officials also continue to resist my efforts at my 67th age. 
What we understand from the synopsis of plight- 
Officials have good salary and support from all cadre of Government to save corrupted ones with the backing of so called Provision in court both Judicial and Quasi Judicial, like CDRCs, Human Rights Commissions, etc.

My plight covered by Malayalam Manorama, The Hindu, Deepika, Deccan Chro<ng>nic</ng>le, etc.. and are at my face book account.
Shall I await for an early justice from the Authorities concerned within my last days and which will light to effectively to formation of New safety measures to self employed personals and prevent such bad experiences suffering by me and family.
