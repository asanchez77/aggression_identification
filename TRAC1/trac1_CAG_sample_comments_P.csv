6,nice,"Marxism shows you the way out of human misery, though how you practice it depends on your own understanding. The rightist philosophies on the other hand hit a blind alley, just as religious preachers talk of very <ng>nice</ng> things while practising and endorsing the exact opposite. As regards,  Stalins and Pol Pots, their number in the rightist camp is hugely higher.

12,nic,"A Question of Order
India, Turkey, and the Return of Strongmen

What happens when a democratically elected leader evolves into an authoritarian ruler, limiting press freedom, civil liberties and religious and eth<ng>nic</ng> tolerance?

India and Turkey are two of the world’s biggest democracies—multi-eth<ng>nic</ng> nations that rose from their imperial past to be founded on the values of modernity. They have fair elections, open markets, and freedom of religion.

Yet this is an account of how the charismatic strongmen Narendra Modi, in India, and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, in Turkey, used the power they had won as elected heads of state to push their countries toward authoritarian ways.",CAG
